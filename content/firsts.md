## New Firsts

Part of my ethic for Year Zero is to do new things. These are some of the new things that I've done and new things I've achieved.

<ul>
<li><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> 15 February - Seminar at Harvard University</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> 10 April -  Review paper published (on [Robotic Telescopes in Education](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21672857.2017.1303264))</li>
