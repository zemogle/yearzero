## New Firsts

Part of my ethic for Year Zero is to do new things. These are some of the new things that I've done and new things I've achieved.

<ul>
<li><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Seminar at Harvard University</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Review paper published (on [Robotic Telescopes in Education](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21672857.2017.1303264))</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Hiked to the top of Snowdon</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Saw Alien in the undercroft of Cardiff Castle</li>
</ul>

## Old Firsts

There are plenty of things that I enjoy doing, which are significant. I'm going to log these here too. Don't worry, its not going to feature anything **too** personal.

<ul>
<li><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Science of Doctor Who talk - 25 January, British Science Fiction Association, London</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Radio Appearance - 14 March, Science Cafe, BBC Radio Wales</li>

<li><i class="fa fa-angle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Trip to California (to LCO headquarters) - 1 June</li>

</ul>
