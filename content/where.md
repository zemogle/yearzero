I carried my phone with me almost everywhere in 2017. I used Swarm (formerlly the 'check in' part of Foursquare) to track the places I went. I then wrote some code to extract that from the Foursquare API and produce the map above and the lists below. All of the [code is on GitHub - you can fork me](https://github.com/zemogle/wherehaveibeen)!

# Steps

I walked **2,999,935** steps during Year Zero. That about **1872 km**.
